I had trouble running this until I ran a node servier by running the command 'http-server -c-1' in the following directory: "~/Documents/TalksPresentationsWorkshops$" 
and then navigating to the following file: "~/Documents/TalksPresentationsWorkshops/FundamentalsOfD3.js/MyExamples/MyFirstExample/index.html$"

Note, I attempted to navigate to a directory deaper than "~/Documents/TalksPresentationsWorkshops$". But this did not work.
