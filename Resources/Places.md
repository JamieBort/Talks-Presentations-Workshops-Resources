At this [meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/DevsRTP/events/258294662/) Maria Lamardo hosted and presented. (now found here: https://devsrtp.com/) After her presentation we had the choice to join a software project. All three allow for some great real world experience as if you were collaborating on a team in a job. If you are interested in learning more and/or joining a software team, reach out to her.
