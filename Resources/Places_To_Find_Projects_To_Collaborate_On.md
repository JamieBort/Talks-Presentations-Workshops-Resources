# Places_To_Find_Projects_To_Collaborate_On

This document was created for my own reference. And to share with others.

It was copied from [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ty843tUH76rqN3I_Vfqdi3B3HqE0_23BkxCvPOJEfW0/edit#). 


Iâ€™ll add more suggestions as I think of them. 

Feel free to add your own or organize the document by creating a pull request.
